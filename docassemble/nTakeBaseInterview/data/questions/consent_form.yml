    1.  Each session lasts for fifty (50) minutes. You are urged to ensure that your child is on time for all sessions. If you find that you are unavailable to attend a scheduled appointment, it is your responsibility to cancel at least 48 hours prior to the appointment or you will be required to pay for the missed session.  Exceptions are made only in an emergency, and at my discretion.
    
    2.  There will be a cost of JM$4,500.00 for each session.  For online sessions, please pay this amount in advance.  For face-to-face sessions, payment should be made at the front desk of Family Life Ministries.
    
    3.  You agree that my providing counselling services for your child/children is not and shall not be a conflict of interest with any other affiliation I may have with you.
    
    4.  By giving permission for your child/children to enter into therapy with me, we have begun a helping relationship in which I commit to assist your child/children to resolve his/her/their problems.
